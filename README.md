## Usage
To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:
```bash

```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the app in your default web browser.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following key libraries:
- **Streamlit:** For building the web application
- **PyMuPDF (fitz):** For handling PDF files
- **Pillow (PIL):** For image processing
- **ReportLab:** For generating new PDF files
- **streamlit-pdf-viewer:** For viewing PDFs within the Streamlit app

Ensure all dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file for easy installation.

## Code Explanation
Here is a brief explanation of the main components of the code:

### Processing Function
The `process_pdf` function takes an input PDF file and a filter level to adjust the inversion. It uses PyMuPDF to read the PDF, Pillow to invert the colors, and ReportLab to generate the new PDF.

### Main UI Layout
The Streamlit app layout includes sections for uploading files, adjusting the inversion level, and viewing or downloading the processed PDFs.

### Customization and Processing
When users upload PDFs and start the processing, the app shows progress bars and messages. Processed files are stored in the session state and can be downloaded or viewed using `streamlit-pdf-viewer`.
